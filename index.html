<h2>TERMITES</h2>
* Termites - 49% of articles about termites published between 2003-2013 were about how to exterminate them. This is interesting because, humans appreciate eusocial insects like bees and ants, but we don't appreciate termites because they eat something we value, wood.
<br>
<br>
 * Termites have special microbes in their guts that allow them to digest wood.
<br>
<br>
 * Eusociality is the highest he highest level of organization of sociality, and is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care, overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups.
<br>
<br>
 * White people saw eusocial insects, not as insects, but as a mirror of their own societies, e.g. "King at the top, with aristocrates in the middle, labourers at the bottom". The notion of male rule wasn't dislodged until the 1670s, when dutch anatomist Jan Swammerdam "discovered" that the King bees had overaries, making them queens.
<br>
<br>
* The view that eusocial insects were humans in insect suits persisted, in 1781 english naturalist  henry smithman delivered a report to the royal society on the termites he had researched in west africa. He praised their "wonderful economy" and compared to termite "gentry" to that of england. "Like their human counterparts, termite aristocrates were worthless and lived off the labour of others" this, said Smithman, wasn't a critism. Nature had, so ordered it.
<br>
* Interesting how europeans use false analogies like this to justify their own flawed societies.
<br>
* In-fact, in the 19th century, eusocial insects were used to justify everything from racism to anarchism. Some scientists claimed that lighter coloured ants took darker coloured ants as slaves, and thus concluded that slavery had a natural basis.
<br>
<br>
* The view that eusocial insects were humans in insect suits STILL persisted. In fact, the russian zoologist Peter Kropotkin wrote about how eusocial insects provided a template for a cooperative and egalitarian utopia in his 1902 book, mutual aid.
<br>
* By the time the American biologist Debra Gordan studied ant colonies in the 1970s, the metaphor had once again been updated. Eusocial were now "assembly line workers , endlessly repeating simple taks in colonies that resembled post-war factories".
<br>
*It wasn't until later that europeans would start to see how unlike humans eusocial insects really were.
<br>
<br>

*Eusocial insects provid an evolutionary conundrum. The fittest individuals moving on to produce off-string doesn't apply to eusocial insects, because they typcially have one queen (and her mate) doing the reproducing. So how did non-fertile termites (the vast majority), evolve then?
<br>
*It's better to thing of termites as a super organism that evolved as one unit, according to American biologist William Wheeler (early 20th century)
<br>
<br>
* Termites are eusocial creatures. Meaning that if you put one termite in a petri dish, it will aimlessly wander around. If you put 40 in a petri dish, they will circle the dish with great purpose. If you put a couple of thoasand, and some mud, they will start to build very complex structures that can be 30 ft tall.
<br> <br>
* Termite mounds are like lungs. Taking oxygen in, and expelling C02 at the base.
<br><br>
* Termites of the macrotermes genus build mounds that ALWAYS incline at exactly 19 degrees from north. They also have a symbiotic relationship with termatomises, which they use to help digest cellulose. Does this fungus control the termites with pheromones, telling them where to build?
<br>
<br>
 * If we figured out how termite guts work, and could convert dry biomass (trees, straw, and grass), into energy, and we could live off of "grassoline"
<br>
<br>
* Eusociality is probably the way of the future for robots. Instead of one, super smart creature that can do everything. We'd have a lot of robots, that are dumb on their own, but can do complex tasks together.
<br>
* In 2014, Havard came out with a robot called Termes. It used it's sensors to respond to external stimilu. Collectivly, many termes robots could build complex structures without central command. Just like termites.
<br>
* It's important to remember that termites on their own dont have the knowledge to build complex structures. They are dumb. But together, they are smart. That is called swarm intelligence.
