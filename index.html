<h2>TERMITES</h2>
* Termites - 49% of articles about termites published between 2003-2013 were about how to exterminate them. This is interesting because, humans appreciate eusocial insects like bees and ants, but we don't appreciate termites because they eat something we value, wood.
<br>
<br>
 * Termites have special microbes in their guts that allow them to digest wood.
<br>
<br>
 * Eusociality is the highest he highest level of organization of sociality, and is defined by the following characteristics: cooperative brood care, overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups.
<br>
<br>
 * White people saw eusocial insects, not as insects, but as a mirror of their own societies, e.g. "King at the top, with aristocrates in the middle, labourers at the bottom". The notion of male rule wasn't dislodged until the 1670s, when dutch anatomist Jan Swammerdam "discovered" that the King bees had overaries, making them queens.
<br>
<br>
* The view that eusocial insects were humans in insect suits persisted, in 1781 english naturalist  henry smithman delivered a report to the royal society on the termites he had researched in west africa. He praised their "wonderful economy" and compared to termite "gentry" to that of england. "Like their human counterparts, termite aristocrates were worthless and lived off the labour of others" this, said Smithman, wasn't a critism. Nature had, so ordered it.
<br>
* Interesting how europeans use false analogies like this to justify their own flawed societies.
<br>
* In-fact, in the 19th century, eusocial insects were used to justify everything from racism to anarchism. Some scientists claimed that lighter coloured ants took darker coloured ants as slaves, and thus concluded that slavery had a natural basis.
<br>
<br>
* The view that eusocial insects were humans in insect suits STILL persisted. In fact, the russian zoologist Peter Kropotkin wrote about how eusocial insects provided a template for a cooperative and egalitarian utopia in his 1902 book, mutual aid.
<br>
* By the time the American biologist Debra Gordan studied ant colonies in the 1970s, the metaphor had once again been updated. Eusocial were now "assembly line workers , endlessly repeating simple taks in colonies that resembled post-war factories".
<br>
*It wasn't until later that europeans would start to see how unlike humans eusocial insects really were.
<br>
<br>

*Eusocial insects provid an evolutionary conundrum. The fittest individuals moving on to produce off-string doesn't apply to eusocial insects, because they typcially have one queen (and her mate) doing the reproducing. So how did non-fertile termites (the vast majority), evolve then?
<br>
*It's better to thing of termites as a super organism that evolved as one unit, according to American biologist William Wheeler (early 20th century)
<br>
<br>
* Termites are eusocial creatures. Meaning that if you put one termite in a petri dish, it will aimlessly wander around. If you put 40 in a petri dish, they will circle the dish with great purpose. If you put a couple of thoasand, and some mud, they will start to build very complex structures that can be 30 ft tall.
<br> <br>
* Termite mounds are like lungs. Taking oxygen in, and expelling C02 at the base.
<br><br>
* Termites of the macrotermes genus build mounds that ALWAYS incline at exactly 19 degrees from north. They also have a symbiotic relationship with termatomises, which they use to help digest cellulose. Does this fungus control the termites with pheromones, telling them where to build?
<br>
<br>
 * If we figured out how termite guts work, and could convert dry biomass (trees, straw, and grass), into energy, and we could live off of "grassoline"
<br>
<br>
* Eusociality is probably the way of the future for robots. Instead of one, super smart creature that can do everything. We'd have a lot of robots, that are dumb on their own, but can do complex tasks together.
<br>
* In 2014, Havard came out with a robot called Termes. It used it's sensors to respond to external stimilu. Collectivly, many termes robots could build complex structures without central command. Just like termites.
<br>
* It's important to remember that termites on their own dont have the knowledge to build complex structures. They are dumb. But together, they are smart. That is called swarm intelligence.

<h2>The Reality Game by Samuel Woody</h2>
* In 2010, there was a senator election between Scott Brown (Republican) vs Martha Coakely (democrat). Massachusetts was a liberal stronghold since 1962, so cloakly was the clear favourite. But suddenly, Brown's popularity begun to surge. This is when computer scientists a Wesleyan University notced that Twitter bots, posing like a grassroots movement were engaged in a coordinated attack against Coakly, accusing her of being anti-chathloc. A cursory glance would have told you that the attacks were coming from people in Coaklys state. Not from bots. Eventually these bots were found to be from tech savy trump activists in Ohio.
<br>
<br>
* In 2013, Ukrainians took to the streets to protest agianst pro-russion president Viktor Yaukovych. Russias response? An online offensive. Thoasands of Russia operated social meida accounts and bots spread disinformation directed against the protestors. A similar stategy would be used in the 2016 presidental election
<br>
<br>
* Bots used today are dumb. No AI. 
<br>
* New bots will use "psychograpic data",that is, detailed profiles collated from voters social media pages. 
<br>
<br>
( Why can this happen? In the past, there would be one to many spreading of news (New York Times, CNN, ETC). This would make it hard for conspiracies & fake news to spread because it would have to go through these "vetted" sources. With the spread of social media, we now live in a many to many paradim. Meaning anyone can be the author of a news story. This has created a toxic enviorment.
<br>
<br>
* Social media like Twitter and Facebook now refuse to be the arbitors of truth because they don't want to infrienge on "free speech". So fake news can stay for a long time
<br> 
<br>
* Bots being used for fake news is called Computational Propaganda
<br>
<br>
* "FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER SUICIDE" was published by the Denver Guardian. The story implicated Hillary in a scandalous cover up.
<br>
<br> 
* It was fake, but got 100 shares a minute on facebook. Jestin Coler, an entreprenur from California, and the man who owned the website, wrote this article with the intention of getting clicks, which garnerd him 30k a month.

<br>
*The Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) Group was a psychological warfare company that specialized in collecting and weaponizing data
<br>
* Alexander Nix is SCL's CEO
<br>
* Steve Bannon wanted to work with SCL to win the culture war in America. This was the start of Cambridge Analytica. 
<br>
* SCL would sway elections in Trinidad, South America, the Middle East...  And eventually, the United States (2016 election) and Britian (Brexit)
<br>
* Cambridge Analytica would start by doing a test in Virginia, where they were successfully able to sway voted despite the distaste for the republican senators planned ban on Oral sex
<br> 
*Ended up being sucessful with the statement "You might not agree, but at least you know where I stand. Played to what they knew about the voters Psychology... Stability, lack of surprises. 
<br>
* Cambridge ended up with Facebooks data. And targeted Incels (Young White Men), and did meet ups with them. They were able to sucessfully manipulate and control this large group of people via facebook groups and targetted messages. Basically founding the Alt right.
<br>
* With Brexit, they used their psychoanalyic data to targetted Anti-Immigrant sentiments. 
<br>
<br>
* With overwhealming knowledge of the voters. They are able to weaponize data and control the masses.
